I created my mandala using p5.js Web Editor. I chose to make an atom because I didn't know how to make leaves using the program so this was the closest I could get to making my original design that I did in CLIP STUDIO.

The references I used to make this mandala: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efnl8kPL6Kw&list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0&index=4 , https://p5js.org/reference/
Additional topics I'd like to learn is 3D modeling using Blender and Maya.
